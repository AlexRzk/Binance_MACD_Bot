# Binance_MACD_Bot

This is a trading bot based on MACD intersection for Binance.

I created this bot and tested it by myself. It works pretty good with OCEANUSDT and AMPUSDT. It can be connected to a Telegram Bot and can send notifications with the opened price, the stop loss, the take profit, the volume, the closed price.

For now the bot have a fixed stop loss and take profit but if you want you can add a trailing stop and take profit.

If you modify and post my code somewhere please quote me. Thanks
